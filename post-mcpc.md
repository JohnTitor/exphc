[i]Thousands of years have passed since the calamity… one of the fortunate survivors, you awake in a changed world. Few signs of human life, but nature has rebounded well, wild animals and fruit trees have flourished well. But the radioactive craters remain, posing a significant danger should you stumble across one… or you may be lucky enough to find an old long-abandoned fallout shelter, stocked full of useful supplies… or another player, hostile or friendly, who knows?

The future is in your hands. Whether you would like to seek out other players using radio towers and walkie talkies to band together and rebuild civilization with high-tech industry and plastics and railway networks, roam the land in your high-speed aircraft dropping bombs raiding stealing destroying with your musket or blunderbuss just to watch the world burn, or attempt to live a quiet life in solitude among the wild deer and turkeys, carefully tending to your garden, eating hamburgers and drinking tea in the afternoon – the choice is yours, on the one-and-only Experimental Hardcore Post-Apocalyptic Server.

[i]Thousands of years have passed since the calamity… one of the fortunate survivors, you awake in a changed world. Few signs of human life, but nature has rebounded well, wild animals and fruit trees have flourished. But the radioactive craters remain, posing a significant danger should you stumble across one… or you may be lucky enough to find an old long-abandoned fallout shelter, stocked full of useful supplies… or another player, hostile or friendly, who knows?

The future is in your hands. Whether you would like to seek out other players using radio towers and walkie talkies to band together and rebuild civilization with high-tech industry and plastics and railway networks, roam the land in your high-speed aircraft dropping bombs raiding stealing destroying with your musket or blunderbuss just to watch the world burn, or attempt to live a quiet life in solitude among the wild deer and turkeys, carefully tending to your garden, eating hamburgers and drinking tea in the afternoon – the choice is yours, on the one-and-only Experimental Hardcore Post-Apocalyptic Minecraft Server.

The server is fairly new and sparsely populated at this time. It [url=http://www.reddit.com/r/cakesminerapocalypse/comments/qfh0v/exphc_new_experimental_hardcore_apocalypse_server/%5D]debuted early March 2012[/url] to a smaller community in [url=http://www.reddit.com/r/cakesminerapocalypse]/r/cakesminerapocalypse[/url], and now for the first time is being opened up to a larger audience. As its name implies, ExpHC is experimental, and may or may not be a result of seeing how many mods I can feasibly fit into one server. However, I'm finding out the mods complement each other quite well, creating a unique environment I have not seen anywhere else. If this server looks worthwhile to you, hope to see you join soon!

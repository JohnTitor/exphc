I finally caved and bought a server :). Not sure how well it'll work out, I may completely change it up,
make it private, pass to someone else, or shut it down at any time. But I have it up and running today, so I figured I'd open
it up to the readers of this small subreddit, if anyone is interested in a new take on the hardcore
post-apocalyptic Minecraft server genre, heavily modded. There may be bugs, glitches, or other problems, so this
server should be considered "alpha" quality, hence the name *Experimental Hardcore*. Expect nothing. But
if you still want to join, read on!

All of the above client mods must be correctly installed in order to successfully connect. I realize this may be a 
tedious process, unfortunately, but it is what it is. There are instructions in each of the mod threads
and several YouTube installation videos if you get stuck.
After all the mods are installed, the configuration needs to be modified to match the server:
extract this 
[client configuration archive](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/57628348/exphc/client-config.zip) 
into the Minecraft root, overwriting the existing config files, or 
[manually edit](https://github.com/mushroomhostage/exphc/tree/master/client-config) the config files if you prefer.

**Optional client mods**: (recommended, but its up to you)

* [Magic Launcher](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/939149-launcher-magic-launcher-097-mods-options-news/) - install/uninstall mods without patching jars
* [Not Enough Items](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/909223-110181-smp-chickenbones-mods/) - show all items and crafting recipes 
* [Optifine](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/249637-11-optifine-hd-d6-fps-boost-hd-textures-aa-af/) - graphics and performance improvements
* [MAtmos](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/379925-110-matmos-r10-environmental-sound-atmosphere-simulator/) - environmental sounds for a more immersive experience

**Rules and information**:

* No hacking, cheating, exploiting, x-ray, or unauthorized client mods
* No excessively lagging the server
* Violation of rules = permban
* Rules subject to change at any time
* PvP enabled and difficulty set to maximum 
* Stealing, raiding, robbing, killing, griefing is allowed - this is hardcore

**Technical Specifications**:

* Random spawn, 8k in each direction (16,000 x 16,000 world)
* Death bans set to 1 day
* Professionally hosted VDS
* Eight-core Intel Xeon X5675 3.07 GHz processor
* 8 GB memory, 1 Gbps network uplink
* Hosted in the west coast (USA)

**Server plugins**:

Nothing to install on your side, but FYI, notable plugins installed include:

* [Cake's Miner Apocalypse](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/cakes-miner-apocalypse/) (of course) - radiation, craters, dirty bombs, fallout shelters (slightly customized)
* [RadioBeacon](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/radiobeacon/) - radio towers, relays, portable compass radios
* [EnchantMore](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/enchantmore/) - new enchanted items, rarely found in fallout shelters
* [Writable](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/writable/) - double-right-click to write on paper
* [SilkSpawners](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/silkspawners/) - harvest mob spawners with silk touch
* [BetterDispensers](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/betterdispensers/) - dispensers can face straight up/down
* New unreleased trading plugin - a mysterious global trading network survived the calamity. You can access it by standing near a trade terminal (two enderpearls = lapis lazuli block), holding the item(s) you want give in your hand, and typing /want followed by the item you want.

More experimental plugins or mods may be added or removed or nerfed if needed.

Hope you all enjoy this brand new server. If it sucks or is awesome, please let me know either way, all feedback
appreciated, any suggestions welcome. I can't promise I'll implement everything or fix all problems,
but, I'll consider it, and do what I can. Have fun.

[1.2.5] ExpHC: IC2•RP2•BC•Forestry•HAB•Trees++•THX•JFM•BWM•Mo' Creatures•&more

Hey everyone, after seeing all the awesome mods ported here I couldn't resist setting up my own server combining the mods with several plugins and concepts I've been working on. The result: the Experimental Hardcore Post-Apocalyptic Server, or ExpHC for short.

Unlike many (most?) modded servers, ExpHC is [b]hardcore survival[/b], with maximum difficulty and PvP enabled everywhere and no world protection anywhere. No locked chests, no protected regions, no safe zones. As its a hardcore server, raiding and griefing is allowed, though the server is still fairly peaceful and not much war has erupted yet. To mitigate the anarchy, you [b]spawn in a random location[/b] on the 16,000 x 16,000 map, and deaths result in a 5 minute [b]death ban[/b]. You can reach out to other players using radio beacons, walkie talkies, or GPS, since stumbling across other players is expected to be rare - in this sense, the server is "[b]post-apocalyptic[/b]" in that you awake in the middle of nowhere with no signs of human life and its up to you to survive.

This is the third iteration of ExpHC, now running 1.2.5. Same map, all new mods:

You may find tropical forests with wild berries and fruit trees, amongst the craters and abandoned fallout shelters (stocked full of custom loot).. you can seek out other players using radio towers and walkie talkies to band together and rebuild civilization with high-tech industry and infrastructure, drift over the land in your hot air balloon or helicopter or on the back of an animal exploring the world or nether, fight monsters or other players using bayonets and crossbows and nanosabers, or attempt to live a quiet peaceful life in solitude tending to your bees and tree farms with automated pipes and advanced redstone contraptions in your fully-furnished carefully built home. It is up to you -- and there is much, much more to do than in vanilla Minecraft.

I wrote many of the plugins myself, and ported several of the mods used on this server, so if there are any problems or you have any suggestions let me know;
I can't promise I'll fix or implement everything but am always looking to improve the server.

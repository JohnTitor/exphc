Looking for a hardcore PvP anarchy apocalypse server beyond what vanilla Minecraft has to offer? Try the one and only Experimental Hardcore Post-Apocalyptic Minecraft Server, now running 1.2.5! Same map, all new mods.

You spawn in a random location (apocalyptic style, global chat disabled) and are free to do as you please: no world protection, no locked chests, PvP enabled everywhere, stealing and raiding allowed (hardcore PvP).

But this is no ordinary hardcore server: it is heavily modded to provide a more exciting experience. What mods, you may ask?

You may find tropical forests with wild berries and fruit trees, amongst the craters and abandoned fallout shelters (stocked full of custom loot).. you can seek out [other players](http://i.imgur.com/HgiFu.jpg) using radio towers and walkie talkies to band together and rebuild civilization with high-tech [industry](http://i.imgur.com/bpEwu.jpg) and infrastructure, [drift](http://i.imgur.com/ENJnI.jpg) [over](http://i.imgur.com/7pmgh.jpg) [the land](http://i.imgur.com/xgBVb.jpg) in your hot air balloon or [helicopter](http://i.imgur.com/69UcI.jpg) [or](http://i.imgur.com/3Gj8R.jpg) on the back of an animal exploring the world or nether, fight monsters or other players using bayonets and crossbows and nanosabers, or attempt to live a quiet peaceful life in solitude tending to your bees and tree farms with automated [pipes](http://i.imgur.com/zYfML.jpg) and advanced redstone contraptions in your fully-furnished carefully built home. It is up to you -- and there is much, much more to do than in vanilla Minecraft.

I wrote many of the plugins myself, and ported several of the mods used on this server, so if there are any problems or you have any suggestions let me know;
I can't promise I'll fix or implement everything but am always looking to improve the server.

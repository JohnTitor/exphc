Looking for a hardcore PvP anarchy apocalypse server beyond what vanilla Minecraft has to offer? Try the one and only Experimental Hardcore Post-Apocalyptic Minecraft Server, now running 1.2.5! Same map, all new mods.

You spawn in a random location (apocalyptic style, global chat disabled) and are free to do as you please: no world protection, no locked chests, PvP enabled everywhere, stealing and raiding allowed (hardcore PvP).

But this is no ordinary hardcore server: it is heavily modded to provide a more exciting experience. What mods, you may ask?

You may find tropical forests with wild berries and fruit trees, amongst the craters and abandoned fallout shelters (stocked full of custom loot).. you can seek out [other players](http://i.imgur.com/HgiFu.jpg) using radio towers and walkie talkies to band together and rebuild civilization with high-tech [industry](http://i.imgur.com/bpEwu.jpg) and infrastructure, [drift](http://i.imgur.com/ENJnI.jpg) [over](http://i.imgur.com/7pmgh.jpg) [the land](http://i.imgur.com/xgBVb.jpg) in your hot air balloon or [helicopter](http://i.imgur.com/69UcI.jpg) [or](http://i.imgur.com/3Gj8R.jpg) on a high-tech gravity-defying suite, fight monsters or other players using bayonets and crossbows and nanosabers, or attempt to live a quiet peaceful life in solitude tending to your bees and tree farms with automated [pipes](http://i.imgur.com/zYfML.jpg) and advanced redstone contraptions in your fully-furnished carefully built home. It is up to you -- and there is much, much more to do than in vanilla Minecraft.

**Update 2012/05/21**: Updated a bunch of the mods! If you already setup on the server just *repeat step #1 of the setup instructions* and you should be able to connect again. And then you can enjoy RedPower2 pr5b2, Additional Buildcraft Objects, IC^2 Charcoal Dust, IC^2 Nuclear Control, Jammy Furniture Mod, AnimalBikes, Hot Air Balloons, Smart Moving, and more. As always, any trouble getting setup or problems with the server let me know.

**Update 2012/06/09**: Server has been running great, thanks to all who are playing! Looking into the next mod update, but right now I just updated the smartphones. You can now call other players by speaking their name into a clock (vanilla item), and their phone will ring several times, giving them a chance to answer - if they do, you can talk over arbitrary distances as long as you hold your smartphone in your hand (but be careful about water damage). Hope everyone's enjoying the server so far, if you haven't joined yet feel free to reply here to request whitelisting and I'll send you instructions how to get setup.

**Update 2012/06/15**: Updated mods again! Now running newer versions of Forestry, TubeStuff, Nuclear Control, THX Helicopter, Jammy Furniture, Charging Bench, and also added a handful of new mods: Elemental Creepers, Plugins for Forestry, and IC2 add-ons: Seed Manager, Berries++, HelperCrops, and ExperiMint. *Existing users, simply repeat step #1 of the setup instructions and you should be able to connect again!*

**Update 2012/06/22**: Going to have limited access to the Internet for this coming week; whitelist applications may take longer than usual to process, problems make take longer to fix, but I'll get to them as soon as I can â€“ thanks for your patience. Meanwhile, keep enjoying the server while it works :).

**Update 2012/06/30**: Back! Fortunately the server seems to have been running well in my absence. Finished going through the backlog of whitelist applications. Welcome to the server, ten new users!

**Update 2012/07/10**: Server updated! Details to follow, many new fixes and mods, but if you're already joined, just *repeat step #1 of the setup instructions* to update your client to connect to the newly-updated server. New mods: [Secret Rooms Mod](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/546192-125secretroomsmodsmpbukkit-hidden-pressure-plates/), [Aquaculture](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1285120-125-sspsmp-aquaculture-112-updated-6172012/page__hl__%20aquaculture), [Thermal Expansion](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1297506-125-smp-thermal-expansion-now-with-smp-compatibility/), [Modular Forcefields](http://forum.industrial-craft.net/index.php?page=Thread&threadID=6874), even a [Gravitation Suite](http://forum.industrial-craft.net/index.php?page=Thread&threadID=6915)! Many mods updated, too many to list here, but most notable are new versions of [IndustrialCraft^2](http://wiki.industrial-craft.net/index.php?title=Main_Page), now with working jetpacks, and [Forestry](http://forestry.sengir.net/wiki/), now with soldering irons, mailboxes, and thermionic fabricators. This is the biggest update of ExpHC 1.2.5 yet. Please report any problems, and hope everyone enjoys the new mods and updates!

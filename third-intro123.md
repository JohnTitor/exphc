*Thousands of years have passed since the calamity... one of the fortunate survivors, you regain consciousness drifting
in outer space, awaking in a changed world. 
Few signs of human life, but nature has rebounded well: the jungles, wild berries, and fruit trees have flourished. But the radioactive 
craters remain, posing a significant danger should you stumble across one... or you may be lucky enough to find an old 
long-abandoned fallout shelter, stocked full of useful supplies... or another player, hostile or friendly, who knows?*

*The future is in your hands. Whether you would like to seek out other players using radio towers and walkie talkies to 
band together and rebuild civilization with high-tech industry, drift over the land in your hot air balloon 
or on the back of an animal exploring the world, or attempt to live a quiet peaceful life in solitude tending
to your bees and tree farms with automated pipes and redstone contraptions
-- the choice is yours, on the one-and-only Experimental Hardcore Post-Apocalyptic Minecraft Server.*

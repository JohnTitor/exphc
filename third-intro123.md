Looking for a hardcore PvP anarchy apocalypse server beyond what vanilla Minecraft has to offer? Try the 
one and only Experimental Hardcore Post-Apocalyptic Minecraft Server! 

You spawn in a random location (apocalyptic style)
and are free to do as you please: no world protection, no locked chests, PvP enabled everywhere, stealing and raiding
allowed (hardcore PvP). 

But this is no ordinary hardcore server: it is heavily modded to provide a more interesting
experience. You may find wild berries and fruit trees, amongst the radioactive craters and abandoned fallout shelters
(stocked full of custom loot).. you can seek out other players using radio towers and walkie talkies to 
band together and rebuild civilization with high-tech industry, drift over the land in your hot air balloon 
or on the back of an animal exploring the world, fight monsters or other players using nanosabers and
quantum nanosuits, or attempt to live a quiet peaceful life in solitude tending
to your bees and tree farms with automated pipes and advanced redstone contraptions. It is up to you --
there is much, much more to do than in vanilla Minecraft.

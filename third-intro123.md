*Thousands of years have passed since the calamity... one of the fortunate survivors, you regain consciousness drifting
in outer space, awaking in a changed world. 
Few signs of human life, but nature has rebounded well: the jungles, wild berries, and fruit trees have flourished. But the radioactive 
craters remain, posing a significant danger should you stumble across one... or you may be lucky enough to find an old 
long-abandoned fallout shelter, stocked full of useful supplies... or another player, hostile or friendly, who knows?*

*The future is in your hands. Whether you would like to seek out other players using radio towers and walkie talkies to 
band together and rebuild civilization with high-tech industry, drift over the land in your hot air balloon 
or on the back of an animal exploring the world, or attempt to live a quiet peaceful life in solitude tending
to your bees and tree farms with automated pipes and redstone contraptions
-- the choice is yours, on the one-and-only Experimental Hardcore Post-Apocalyptic Minecraft Server.*

**Launcher**:

1. Run [SKMCLauncher.jar](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1104030-launcher-sks-launcher-v313-easily-install-mods-update-mc-open-source/)
1. Addons... > Install... > choose each of the above files, in order
1. Play > **exphc.com:1230**

*If you had other mods installed (i.e. from ExpHC 1.1), move/rename/delete the old "mods" and "config" directories, or try Switch... > Manage configurations > Modify... > Use a custom path.*

*If you have a newer version of Minecraft, downgrade to 1.2.3 using 
[MCNostalgia](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/800346-tool-mcnostalgia-210-now-works-with-123/) or [MC Downgrader](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/284331-tool-mc-downgrader-the-time-machine-for-minecraft/) or [Version Changer](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/877629-mvc-minecraft-version-changer-135-3/). You can use SK's Launcher to easily switch between versions and mods (I named my jar "minecraft-1.2.3.jar" and the configuration "1.2.3exphc").*

*Some mods will give you a spurious "multiple folders" warning (forestry-client-A-1.4.0.4_bc2.2.jar, immibis-core_48.0.1_for_1.2.3-client.jar, mod_compactsolars-client-2.0.0.zip) but they work anyways.*

**Questions & Answers**

*Isn't it too soon to update?* 
Maybe, but its been about a month since ExpHC 1.1 launched. Time flies eh? ExpHC can't stay on 1.1 forever.. and the time is ripe for change. Also note, a month is a common map reset cycle length on many hardcore servers, so updating at this time isn't all that unusual. Plus ExpHC 1.2.3 offers many compelling improvements over 1.1, dive in and try it out!


*Why update to 1.2.3 instead of 1.2.4?*
Minecraft 1.2.4 was released very recently, and although progress is being made not many mods have updated or been ported yet. Particularly, although MCPC has 1.2.4 test builds there is not much if any of a selection of mods to chose from at this time.

*I have a lot of stuff in the 1.1 world, can I transfer it over to 1.2.3?*
Sure, if you want to do this let me know and I'll see what I can do. Transferring buildings over is possible, but moving inventories is somewhat easier. Note however, not all of the mods are available in both worlds, not everything can be transferred identically, and much of the conversion has to be done manually. But I understand if you made a lot of progress in 1.1 you would want to keep it in 1.2.3,  I'll do my best to move your things over if you ask. On the other hand, also consider this update presents an opportunity for a fresh start.

*Why reset the map for 1.2.3, instead of preserving the old 1.1 map?*
Several reasons: although it is possible to convert maps with different block IDs using tools like midas gold, the number of updated and new and removed and replaced mods and plugins makes this unfeasible. Several mods and plugins offer new and exciting features in the world which wouldn't be available if the map was merely converted. 1.2.3 itself adds jungles, of course. Finally, updating only part of the map with new chunks is not practical either since it is all pre-generated, for performance reasons. Starting from scratch is, I believe, the most logical choice. But see above if you want me to transfer your stuff.

*Will the map be reset again for 1.2.4 or 1.2.5 or future updates?*
To be determined, depending on various factors. I'd like to avoid another reset if I can, and 1.2.4 is looking like a fairly minor update from a server perspective, so preserving the map may be possible. But no promises, sorry. 

*When will the 1.1 world be shutdown?*
The exact date is not yet determined, but I will leave it up for a while for people to move their stuff, or even continue playing in its last days, if you so choose. The system behind these servers is fairly high-performance and is technically capable of running multiple servers simultaneously, in theory the 1.1 server could be left running indefinitely, but of course it won't last forever, and I intend to focus my efforts on the new 1.2.3 server. At some point in the near future, it'll be completely subsumed by 1.2.3.

*I built an awesome base in the 1.1 world I'd like to keep, can I have a copy of the map files?*
Sure, after it shuts down I plan to post a copy of the world, available for download. This will let you use the map on your own server, or play it in in SSP if you prefer. If you want a schematic of your structures earlier, that can be arranged too, let me know.

*Why was my favorite mod from ExpHC 1.1 not added in ExpHC 1.2.3?*
Most likely, it wasn't available for or I had trouble setting it up in 1.2.3. Many of the mods did update, but a few I had to replace with alternatives (each with their own advantages and disadvantages), a couple I really liked but couldn't use in 1.2.3 for various reasons. If you desperately miss a particular mod, I can't promise I'll add it, but definitely let me know your thoughts.

*I have a suggestion for a cool new mod you should add to this server, can you install it?*
I'm always looking for new mods to install! Any suggestions are welcome. Note however that in order to be used, the mod must be SMP capable, and must be ported to CraftBukkit, and I'd also like it to fit within the theme of the server, without overlapping or conflicting with other mods. But don't let that stop you from suggesting any mod. Third parties can and do port mods to SMP and CB, although it isn't an easy task, just keep in mind it might be a while for it happens. 
You can post your suggestions or add them to the [proposed mods](https://github.com/mushroomhostage/exphc/wiki/Proposed-mods) list directly.
Also if you have any proposed server plugins, or even ideas for plugins or mods not yet developed, feel free to ask about it.

*Can I use my favorite client-side mod on ExpHC?*
Only if it is listed in the optional mods section. If not, please don't use it until it is added to the list, in order to not gain an unfair advantage over other players without the mod. 
But if you do have a mod you think would either not give you an unfair advantage or would benefit everyone on the server, feel free to propose it and it'll be considered. 
Note that Rei's Minimap is now allowed on ExpHC 1.2.3, by popular request.

*How do the new mods on ExpHC 1.2.3 compare to the old mods on ExpHC 1.1?*
I think they're better :), for the most part. 

see comparison


*Why the switch from Magic Launcher to SK's Launcher?*
SK's Launcher (skmclauncher) attempts to intelligently determine the structure of the zip archives containing the mods, and do the right thing. No more unzipping and rezipping files, it just works. This is a big win for ExpHC, where getting setup correctly was undoubtedly the biggest hurdle to playing on this server. SK's Launcher was only recently released, and wasn't available at the time of 1.1, but I now prefer it over Magic Launcher for its simplicity and elegance, although both are fine pieces of software. Lastly, SK's Launcher is open source, so anyone can improve on it without waiting for the original developers to update. The setup process for ExpHC 1.2.3 is still not as smooth as it could be, but it should be much easier than before,
largely thanks to SK's Launcher.

*This server is amazing, how can I setup my own server like it?*
I'm glad you asked. I have taken care to document my server setup process on the 
[wiki](https://github.com/mushroomhostage/exphc/wiki), 
which should be helpful if you want to setup a similar server. In fact, inspiring others to setup servers like it is one of my goals in running ExpHC. Integrating all of the mods and plugins together into a coherent server can be a challenge, but its certainly possible, and I believe it is worth it for a unique gaming experience available nowhere else (yet, as far as I know). If you need any help or succeed in setting up a server like this, let me know, and I can add your server as an alternative to ExpHC. If it works well enough, maybe I can even shutdown ExpHC in favor of your server :P.

*Okay enough about setup, I've joined and am ready to play, but there are so many things to do, where should I begin?*
First order of business, I'd recommend finding food and safety --  since this server is set at maximum difficulty, starvation can kill you, and remember this is hardcore PvP, so other players can rob you and kill you if they wish to, completely within the rules (as long as no cheating is involved). Fortunately there are wild fruit trees providing nourishing food, and not all players are hostile, so you'll probably be alright. But if you haven't played much hardcore I suggest reading the 
[newbie guide](http://wiki.hcsmp.com/index.php?title=Newbie_Guide)
from /r/hardcoresmp, keeping in mind ExpHC's differences. Once you've settled in, where to go from there is up to you. If you can't decide, I suggest reading up on a few of the mods, watching a few introductory videos or beginner guides 
and going from there – and if you get lonely, you can setup a radio tower, build a walkie talkie, roam the land looking for adventure, or invite your friends and rendezvous at shared coordinates then work together. It is really up to you.
Personally, I'm planning on [working my way through IndustrialCraft^2](http://wiki.industrial-craft.net/index.php?title=Tutorial:First_Steps), and am also really looking
forward to trying out the new [apiculture (beekeeping)](http://forestry.sengir.net/wiki/index.php?n=Category.Apiculture) feature in Forestry.

*Is there a wiki or something where I can share useful tips and tricks for surviving on ExpHC?*
Yes! [ExpHC now has a wiki](https://github.com/mushroomhostage/exphc/wiki). There isn't much there yet, but it is open for anyone to contribute, offering valuable advice, suggestions, or documenting your experiences. Feel free to edit.

In order to run these mods, ExpHC uses CraftBukkit -- meaning not only are the above mods available
([url=https://github.com/mushroomhostage/exphc/wiki/Mods]more information[/url]),
but also a handful of customized plugins to provide new mechanics. Most of the 
[url=http://dev.bukkit.org/home/server-mods/?search=mushroomhostage]plugins I've developed[/url]
are installed and new plugins or mods may be installed on ExpHC first as I develop or find them;
ExpHC serves as a sort of testbed.  Notable plugins currently installed include:

[list]
[*] [url=http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/cakes-miner-apocalypse/]Cake's Miner Apocalypse[/url] - chainmail, craters, dirty bombs, fallout shelters ([new loot](http://imgur.com/a/xnY6g/))
[*] [url=http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/realisticchat]RealisticChat[/url] - local chat, whispering, yelling, bullhorns, walkie talkies, smartphones
[*] [url=http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/radiobeacon/]RadioBeacon[/url] - radio towers, relays, portable compass radios
[*] [url=http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/atmosphericheights/]AtmosphericHeights[/url] - thinner air at higher elevations
[*] [url=http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/potionsplus/]PotionsPlus[/url] - new potions, rarely found in fallout shelters
[*] [url=http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/enchantmore/]EnchantMore[/url] - new enchanted items, rarely found in fallout shelters
[*] [url=http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/silkspawners/]SilkSpawners[/url] - silk touch picks up monster spawners
[*] Exclusive trading plugin
[/list]

The rules are pretty basic, as you would expect for a hardcore server:

[b]Rules[/b]:

[list]
[*] No hacking, cheating, exploiting, x-ray, or unauthorized client mods
[*] No excessively lagging the server
[*] No asking for free items or teleports
[*] Violation of rules = permban
[*] Stealing, raiding, robbing, killing, griefing is allowed - this is [u]hardcore[/u]
[*] Rules subject to change 
[/list]


[b]General Information[/b]:
[list]
[*] PvP enabled, max difficulty
[*] 16,000 x 16,000 map + random spawn
[*] Death ban 5 min
[*] Hosted in USA with 1 Gbps uplink 24/7
[*] 8 GB memory with eight-core CPU on a VDS
[/list]

[b]How to Join[/b]:

Interested in playing? 

[i]You need to install the mods before connecting[/i]. Fortunately, this may be easier than you expect, I've provided step-by-step setup instructions here: [url=https://github.com/mushroomhostage/exphc/wiki/Setup]Setup[/url].  Any problems getting setup, let me know and I'll try to help.

After your client is modded, [i]reply here to be whitelisted[/i], including your in-game name and a brief reason of why you want to join or any kind of other information (anything will do, all I really want is something to break up the monotony of going through whitelist requests). I'll add you as soon as I can and you'll be able to play in no time. 

Hope everyone enjoys this server! It is, as its name implied, experimental -- with a unique mix of mods and plugins -- any feedback is appreciated.
